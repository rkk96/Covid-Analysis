## Problem Statement

This Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of key pandemic data spanning from 2020 to 2024, focusing on critical metrics such as total deaths, total active cases, and total new cases. Additionally, the dashboard includes detailed visualizations of vaccination reports, the country's GDP, and the stringency index of implemented measures. Designed to aid policymakers and healthcare professionals in understanding the progression of the pandemic and the effectiveness of interventions, the dashboard provides valuable insights into the country's health status, economic impact, and response strategies over the years.

With intuitive visualization and in-depth analysis, the dashboard enables users to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on public health and the economy, as well as the stringency of measures implemented to control its spread. Whether assessing vaccination rates, economic resilience, or the severity of containment measures, the dashboard highlights the trends, challenges, and areas that require attention. This wealth of information empowers decision-makers to make data-driven policy decisions, allocate resources effectively, and develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and ensure the well-being of the population.
